## 2024 NASA SPACE APPS HACKATHON
The NASA Space Apps Challenge is an annual global hackathon that brings together developers, scientists, engineers.

## Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making

### Problem Statement
The problem statement is to develop a solution that leverages Earth observation data to support informed agricultural decision-making

What our team (Space monks) leveraged NASA SMAP(Soil Moisture Anaomaly Data) to visualize the soil moisture distribution in Africa.



## Tools and technologies to develop our solution:
* Arduino
* C++
* Solenoid valve
* Soil moisture sensor
